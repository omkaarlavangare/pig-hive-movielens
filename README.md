# MovieLens Dataset
Here, I have performed some basic analysis on the movielens dataset, through Pig and Hive.
## Scripts
I have done the same analysis but with different languages.<br>
Also, I have kept the structure of the scripts same for different analysis as anybody can easily figure out what changes have been made and how a particular script is different from other.
